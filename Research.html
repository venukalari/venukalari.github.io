To understand ourselvses, our world around us, and to make sense of our lonliness in the vastness of time and space

                                    we now know that due to the accelerating expansion of the Universe, in a few billion years, these stars will not become visible to us. This is because they will be moving away from us so fast that light from them cannot reach us. And a few billion years before, much of the currently visible Universe was not formed yet, and neither were there enough of the elements necessary for life.
                                    
                                    How, and why do these stars form is a very exciting to     </p>

                                    Almost every single thing that we see around us, is made from the remnants of stars that have died. Once we die, our remains too will in time form material that one day will form a new star. We now know that a few billion years before, or after, neither us, nor these stars would be visible to each other. So in this brief, amazing moment in the Universe, us humans, are incredibly priveliged to see and understand where we came from.  </p>
